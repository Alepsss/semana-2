<h1>Hey there </h1>

<p>Hi there! My name is Johanss, and I'm 34 years old. I live in Spain and currently work as a sales assistant at Madrid-Barajas Airport. However, I have decided to switch careers and pursue programming. Although I'm just a beginner, I'm eager to learn as much as I can about this exciting field.
I have a 4-year-old daughter and three pets - two dogs and a cat - that bring me joy and adventure. I'm also an amateur boxer, although I can't do it professionally anymore due to some injuries.
</p>

<p>
I'm originally from Venezuela, but I moved to Spain when I was 19 in search of new opportunities. Since then, I've worked hard to build a life here, and now I'm excited to start a new chapter in my career.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I've been studying some JavaScript on my own, and I'm excited to continue learning more about this language and other programming languages. I'm highly motivated by the possibility of exploring new opportunities and developing skills in a field that I'm passionate about.
In summary, I'm a programming enthusiast with a strong desire to learn and improve. I'm excited to see where this new adventure takes me and hope to keep learning and growing in this field.
</p>
    
<h2>Usually...</h2>

<p>
I'm passionate about technology and everything related to online gaming and programming. I love spending hours in front of my computer immersed in virtual worlds and challenging other players from all over the world.
</p>
<p>
Through my love for online gaming, I have been fortunate enough to make online friends who share my interests. I also enjoy exploring the world of programming and learning about new technologies that can enhance my gaming experience.
</p>
<p>
I'm always looking for ways to improve my programming skills and find new ways to combine my two passions. I believe that technology and online gaming can have a positive impact on our lives and I'm excited to be a part of this constantly evolving community.
</p>
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>
Additionally, I'm fortunate to have friends who are programmers and help me improve my skills in this field and provide support when I need it. I love collaborating with them on programming projects and working together to solve problems and create innovative solutions.
